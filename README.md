# CPE301_FinalProject
## Foster Schmidt

This was a final project for my CPE301 Embedded Systems class at University of Nevada, Reno Fall 2022.
The idea was to build the embedded portion of a "swamp cooler" from the [Elegoo "The Most Complete Starter kit"](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-mega-2560-the-most-complete-starter-kit).
I did the project by myself, and that is why there is only one commit of my finalized project.
